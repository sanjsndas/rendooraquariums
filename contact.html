                                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Can I get a price estimate over the phone without a detailed quote?</h3>
                                <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                                    While we can provide very general price ranges over the phone for certain standard products, custom aquarium installations require a detailed understanding of your specific needs, design preferences, and site conditions. Therefore, a precise price estimate for a custom project typically requires a formal quote request submission and an initial consultation. This ensures accuracy and avoids misunderstandings, as the cost of a bespoke aquarium can vary significantly based on complexity and materials.

                                <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                                    For custom aquarium projects, especially those involving built-in wall installations or room dividers, providing architectural drawings of your space can significantly expedite the design and planning process. Once you have submitted your initial custom quote request and our design consultant has contacted you, they will provide you with secure methods for sharing sensitive documents such as blueprints, floor plans, or structural schematics. This may include a secure client portal with encrypted upload capabilities, or direct email communication for smaller files. We prioritize the confidentiality and security of your architectural data, ensuring that all shared documents are handled with the utmost care and professionalism. These drawings allow our design and engineering teams to meticulously plan the integration of your Rendoor aquarium into your existing or planned structure, considering load-bearing requirements, plumbing, electrical access, and aesthetic harmony. Early provision of such details helps us to identify any potential challenges and engineer precise solutions, ensuring a seamless and structurally sound installation that complements your architectural vision without compromise. Our collaborative approach with architects and contractors is enhanced by the timely exchange of accurate technical documentation, leading to a more efficient and successful project outcome.
