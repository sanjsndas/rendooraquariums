                            Our website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt the transmission of sensitive data, such as information submitted through our contact and quote request forms. This encryption creates a secure link between your browser and our server, ensuring that data remains private and integral during transit.

                            Access to your personal information is restricted to employees who need to know that information to perform their job functions, such as customer service, design consultants, and technical support. All employees with access to personal data undergo regular privacy and security training, emphasizing the importance of data confidentiality and adherence to our strict internal protocols. This human element of security is critical in preventing unauthorized access.

These files merely log visitors to the site â€“ usually a standard procedure for hosting companies and a part of hosting services' analytics. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.
